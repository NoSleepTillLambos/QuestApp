### Project Description

The project features three different categories, History, Sports and Television. The player is able to select any of these three and 
test themselves against the questions I have designed

### Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAjwm8WZBhBUEiwA178UnDn9nF-CRrhcI0D_6H7EhBtmU8kK2DkGulFY6qTHYwRr2uJtlHJRGBoCqlQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) installed on your machine.
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The development process consisted of designing wireframes, structuring the pages and questions. <br/>
from there I was able to create and setup the various pages with the questions and complete the frontend. 

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
Highlights of the project were being able to work with the Kotlin langauge and testing myself to work with new software, 
I found the syntax and language in general to be a very rewarding one when working out issues and solving bugs

#### Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was learning a new language and working with the new syntax that comes along with it. <br/> 
Getting the storage and high scores to work also proved to be a bit of a challenge at times, all in all though it was great to be able to experiment <br/> 
and test the waters. 

<!-- MOCKUPS -->

#### Future Implementation

In the future i would like to add high scores for every category <br/>
I would like to add different methods of answering questions such as tapping on and typing in inputs
